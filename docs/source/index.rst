``diffpy.srxplanar`` is built and maintained with `scikit-package <https://scikit-package.github.io/scikit-package/>`_.

diffpy.srxplanar package provides 2D diffraction image integration using
non splitting pixel algorithm. And it can estimate and propagate statistic
uncertainty of raw counts and integrated intensity. If you are using this
software. If you use this program to do productive scientific research that
leads to publication, we kindly ask that you acknowledge use of the program
by citing the following paper in your publication:

    statistical uncertainties on powder diffraction and small angle
    scattering data from 2-D x-ray detectors, arXiv:1309.3614
